# RPI buildroot based image builder

This is a RPI Zero W (rpi3 in some future) buildroot based linux build system.
Currently a push to this repo will trigger a build which will create a new build image.

## Why?

Because I find other distros slow on the RPI's and I find buildroot easy to understand.

## What's on it?

The image contains a complete buildroot environment which can be used to generate a functional raspberry sd card image.
This repo is used to create the build image which is going to be used later on to build actual sd images.

The output of this build on drone.io is just the builder image not the final sd card image.

The sd card image will be generated by another build job from one on more repos.

The default buildroot setup contains:

- rpi0w firmware and kernel from raspberry github
- systemd as init system
- docker
- wpa-supplicant and tools to get wifi going 

I intend to create a collection of docker images to run on it see how it goes.
